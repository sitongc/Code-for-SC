# Code-for-Sitong Chen
This repository contains a comprehensive set of scripts and tools for analyzing RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq (SC-RNAseq), whole genome sequencing (WGS) data, machine learning, and various other tasks.

## Project introduce

**RNA-seq Analysis**: Tools and scripts for processing and analyzing bulk RNA sequencing data.

**SC-RNAseq Analysis**: Methods for analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data, including clustering and differential expression analysis.

**Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) Analysis**: Pipelines for variant calling, genome assembly, and other WGS tasks.

**Machine Learning**: Machine learning models for classification, regression, and clustering of omics data.

**Miscellaneous Tasks**: Scripts for various random tasks related to omics data analysis.

## Requirements 




## RNA-seq pipeline

All of the scripts are available in **Scripts/RNA-seq/**. 

Besides the softwares were mentions in the pipeline, this part also include 2 other splicing variant softwares, rMATS and Leafcutter. 

It also provided the **Snakemake** version.
